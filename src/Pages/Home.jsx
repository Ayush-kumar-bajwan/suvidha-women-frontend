                    <h1 className="text-xl"><IoMdArrowDropright className="inline text-3xl"/>  At Suvidha Womens Health & Wellness Initiative, we are dedicated to empowering rural women by providing access to essential health education, wellness resources, and community support. <br />
                    <IoMdArrowDropright className="inline text-3xl"/>  Millions of women in rural areas face challenges like limited healthcare access, lack of awareness, and social taboos around womenâ€™s health. Suvidha was founded to break these barriers and create a safe, supportive space where women can learn, grow, and take control of their well-being. <br />
                    <IoMdArrowDropright className="inline text-3xl"/>  Through workshops, health camps, and educational resources, we aim to spread awareness about menstrual hygiene, pregnancy care, birth control, and overall well-beingâ€”ensuring that every woman, no matter where she lives, has the knowledge and support she needs.
